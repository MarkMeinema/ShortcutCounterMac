# ShortcutCounterMac
A MacOS menubar app that tracks the number of keyboard shortcuts you press in a log file. This can be useful if you want to get an idea of which shortcuts you use and how often. Based on the log, you could then analyze how much time you save compared to performing these actions with the mouse.
